My name is Tiara! 
I’m an artistic hippie trying to make a difference in society. I’ve always been the type to help people. I even thought about being a psychologist my freshman year of college. I just could never shake the creative gene in me. So I thought, “why not combine both?” Merge the two, my love for helping people with my passion for art, and see what type of career I can have. 
Who would've thought I would be at Emerson College majoring in visual media arts? I’ve done a number of projects that convey meaningful and rich messages revolving around topics such as:

Women’s rights
Racial equality
LGBTQ
Self love

There’s definitely no turning back! I’m doing this for the audience. The content, the truths within the stories, are all real and relate to many individuals in the world. 
It’s everyone’s duty to advocate for the marginalized groups. Therefore, I love creating with revolutionaries that focus on equality as their theme. The work I’ve done and have been a part of includes: 

Videos/short films
Short essays
Poetry
Photography 
I hope you’re touched and enlightened while experiencing these works of art.
